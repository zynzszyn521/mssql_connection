    ```dart
    import 'package:mssql_connection/mssql_connection.dart';
    ```

4. **Initialize the Connection**: Create an instance of `MssqlConnection` to use the plugin:

    ```dart
    MssqlConnection mssqlConnection = MssqlConnection.getInstance();
    ```

5. **Use the Plugin**: Now you're ready to use the MsSQL Connection plugin to interact with your Microsoft SQL Server database.

### Connect to Database

To establish a connection to the Microsoft SQL Server database, use the `connect` method. This method takes the server details, including IP, port, database name, username, and password.

```dart
// Example: Connect to the database
bool isConnected = await mssqlConnection.connect(
  ip: 'your_server_ip',
  port: 'your_server_port',
  databaseName: 'your_database_name',
  username: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  timeoutInSeconds: 15,
);

// Returns a boolean indicating the connection status.
```
### Get Data

Retrieve data from the connected database using the `getData` method. Pass the SQL query as parameter to `getData` method to fetch the desired information.

```dart
// Example: Fetch data from the database
String query = 'SELECT * FROM your_table';
String result = await mssqlConnection.getData(query);

// Returns a string containing the fetched data in JSON format.
```

### Write Data

Write data to the connected database using the `writeData` method. Pass the SQL query as parameter to `writeData` method for database modification.

```dart
// Example: Update data in the database
String query = 'UPDATE your_table SET column_name = "new_value" WHERE condition';
String result = await mssqlConnection.writeData(query);

// Returns a string containing information about the operation, e.g., affected rows.
```

### Disconnect

Terminate the database connection using the disconnect method.

```dart
// Example: Disconnect from the database
bool isDisconnected = await mssqlConnection.disconnect();

// Returns a boolean indicating the disconnection status.
```

These methods cover the basic functionalities provided by the MsSQL Connection plugin. Customize the SQL queries according to your database schema and requirements.
